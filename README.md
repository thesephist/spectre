# Spectre ðŸ‘»

**Spectre** is my investigation into using
[sparse autoencoders](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features)
to interpret and manipulate text with my
[Contra family of text embedding models](https://huggingface.co/collections/thesephist/contra-bottleneck-t5-651b5f1e26b2dee1ed16429e).

## Overview

This repo is still a work in progress, but you can find some end-to-end working
sample code in [`./notebooks](./notebooks) that demonstrates how to use a sparse
autoencoder to interpret and manipulate text with Contra models.
